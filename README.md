## Description
These are the R codes used for the simulation study and empirical data application of Joint Sparse Principal Component Analysis. The analyses were done as one of the four traineeships of the Research Master in Social andn Behavioral Science at Tilburg University. The main method (joint sparse PCA) was proposed and developed by Dr. Katrijn Van Deun, who supervised this traineeship. 

The repository consists of the codes for the **Simulation Study** and **Empirical Data Analysis** using the Genetic Dataset (provided by Dr. Van Deun).
